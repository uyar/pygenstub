pygenstub is a utility for generating stub files from docstrings
in source files. It takes a source file as input and creates a stub file
with the same base name and the ``.pyi`` extension.

:PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygenstub/
:Repository: https://bitbucket.org/uyar/pygenstub
:Documentation: https://pygenstub.readthedocs.io/

If the docstring of a function includes a **sig** field, the value of that
field will be used to generate a prototype by matching the types to the
parameters in the same order. For example, for the code given below:

.. code-block:: python

   def foo(a, b):
       """Do foo.

       :sig: (int, str) -> None
       """

pygenstub will generate the following stub:

.. code-block:: python

   def foo(a: int, b: str) -> None: ...

pygenstub consists of a single module which itself contains signatures.
You can see the `source code`_ and the autogenerated `stub file`_
as an example.

Usage
-----

pygenstub has been tested with Python 2.7, Python 3.4+, PyPy2 5.7+,
and PyPy3 5.7+. You can install the latest version using ``pip``::

  pip install pygenstub

Installation creates a script named ``pygenstub`` which can be used
as follows::

  pygenstub foo.py

This command will generate the file ``foo.pyi`` in the same directory
as the input file. If the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.

Sphinx autodoc support
----------------------

If pygenstub is activated as a Sphinx extension (after autodoc), it will insert
type comments for parameters and return values in the docstring. It will also
remove the signature fields to exclude them from the output:

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = [
       'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
       'pygenstub'
   ]

As an example of the output, you can see the `API documentation`_
for pygenstub itself.

.. _stub file: https://bitbucket.org/uyar/pygenstub/src/tip/pygenstub.pyi
