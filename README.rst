pygenstub
=========

pygenstub is a utility for generating stub files from docstrings
in source files.

If the docstring of a function includes a **sig** field,
the value of that field will be used to generate a stub
by matching the types to the parameters in the same order.

For example, for the function given below:

.. code-block:: python

   def foo(a, b):
       """Do foo.

       :sig: (int, str) -> None
       """

pygenstub will generate the following stub:

.. code-block:: python

   def foo(a: int, b: str) -> None: ...

pygenstub consists of a single `source file`_ which contains such signatures.
You can check the `stub file`_ generated by running pygenstub on itself
as an example.

Getting started
---------------

pygenstub runs on Python 3.4+. It also supports Python 2.7 and PyPy.
You can install the latest version from `PyPI`_::

  pip install pygenstub

Installation creates a script named ``pygenstub`` which can be used
as follows::

  pygenstub foo.py

This command will generate the file ``foo.pyi`` in the same directory
as the input file.
If the output file already exists, it will be overwritten.

If you download the `source file`_, you can also run it directly
without installing::

  python pygenstub.py foo.py

If pygenstub is activated as a Sphinx extension (after *sphinx.ext.autodoc*),
it will insert type comments into the docstring:

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = [
       "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
       "pygenstub"
   ]

As an example of the output, you can check the `API documentation`_
for pygenstub itself.
